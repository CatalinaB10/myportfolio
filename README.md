Here is a small part of my recent work. These are not projects made for a client or a company, they were developed by me to exercise with HTML, CSS , JavaScript and React.js. Latest folder called Figma shows some prototypes for websites with different purposes.
Please feel free to navigate through the files I had attached to take a closer look to my work.

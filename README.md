Here is a small part of my recent work. Lately I have been exploring Android Apps development and working with Kotlin, Android SDK, Jetpack Compose  other mobile technologies,  but first I started with basic web sites and try my best to replicate famous pages using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript, also a bit of React.js. 
Latest folder called Figma shows some prototypes for websites with different purposes.
Please feel free to navigate through the files I had attached to take a closer look to my work.
Update! 
Lately I am into Flutter and I have developed a small project for academic purpose that is still under expansion. The app is intended for fitness centers/gyms and their clients.
